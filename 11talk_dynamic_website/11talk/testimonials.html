Both of them have tried the "Let's Go Series" class, and it was very beneficial for them. T. Ramon was persistent and very capable of handling kids. For sure, my kids have improved in English. They can pronounce words and identify things around them in English. I would highly recommend 11talk to parents who want their children to learn English in their formative years.</blockquote>

So while I was looking for English classes related to practical business and jobs, I came across 11talk. There were many courses in 11talk, among which I was able to focus on English interviews and business English by applying for classes from Special Courses. I learned a lot about English through this class, but the major thing seems to be that I have developed English confidence. I am so satisfied, and I think I can do well in the upcoming English interview. </blockquote>
